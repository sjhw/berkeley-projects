## Overview
This README provides a brief overview of the final project I completed as part of a machine learning course at UC Berkeley. In this project, I applied my expertise in complex machine learning methods to a subject that was unfamiliar to me initially. The experience was both challenging and rewarding as I navigated the application of advanced techniques to achieve surprising results.

## Project Goals
The primary objective of this project was to leverage my understanding of complex machine learning methods to tackle a domain outside of my comfort zone. Despite my limited knowledge of the NBA, an exciting opportunity presented itself when a group member suggested an NBA-related project. The prospect of applying my machine learning knowledge beyond my usual domain of health was intriguing and fun. By doing so, I aimed to not only expand my skill set but also demonstrate the versatility of these techniques in various domains. The project also focused on honing my collaboration and reporting skills as I worked on a comprehensive final report.

## Accomplishments

Some key accomplishments from this project include:
- **Successful Application of Complex Methods**: I successfully identified random forests as a promising method for the task, showcasing the versatility of the method in tasks that involve binary classification with potentially missing or unbalanced data.
- **Random Forests Model Development**: My main contribution in this project involved the development of the [random forests model](https://github.com/jhwang0703/ml_and_nba/blob/main/random_forest_model.ipynb). This encompassed data preprocessing, feature engineering, evaluation, model training, and optimization.
- **Surprising Results**: The results obtained from my model were pleasantly surprising, correctly predicting the NBA champion over the past 15 years (2008-2022) 12 out of 15 times. This included the challenging pandemic-affected playoffs during 2020.
- **Comprehensive Final Report**: I assisted in the creation of a detailed final report that documented the entire project lifecycle, from problem formulation to methodology, results, and conclusions. This report serves as a valuable reference for understanding the project's scope and outcomes.
