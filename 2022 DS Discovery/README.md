In this repo is a screenshot of the main final dashboard I personally created, and a pdf of the final posterboard I created for my team.

The dataset contained data on nearly 14,000 homeless and low-income clients and over 50,000 rows. I was tasked with looking into insights of how long each client spent in the center's programs before finding permanent housing. My work mostly involved creating calculated fields to identify whether a client did or did not find permanent housing at some point, and if so, how long they spent in each specific program before they were able to obtain permanent housing. I also explored the total duration between first contact with St. Joseph Center and the first move-in date to a permanent housing outcome. 

I cannot upload any of the actual Tableau files as they contain sensitive information about the clients of St. Joseph Center, but please feel free to contact me at stephenhwang@berkeley.edu to discuss my work in the dashboard.
